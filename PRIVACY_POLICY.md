# Privacy Policy for Your Expense

Last updated: 2025-11-05

Your Expense ("we", "our", or "us") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your choices. This policy applies to our mobile application available on Google Play and the Apple App Store.

## Information We Collect

- Camera data: Images/video frames captured via your device camera for features like face verification, barcode/QR scanning, and optional profile photo upload.
- Photos: If you choose, images from your photo library for receipt scanning or profile photo.
- Basic app data: Device information (model, OS version), crash logs, and usage analytics necessary to operate and improve the app.
- Purchase data: If you subscribe or make in-app purchases, transaction identifiers provided by the platform.

## How We Use Your Information

- Face verification and App Lock: Camera frames are processed on-device to verify your identity. We do not sell biometric data.
- Barcode/QR scanning: Camera frames are processed on-device to extract codes. No images are sent to our servers unless you choose to upload content.
- Profile image: If you upload a profile photo, the image is transmitted securely to our backend to store and display in your account.
- Receipts/OCR: If you capture or upload receipt images, they may be processed (locally or by our backend) to extract text and save expense entries.
- App functionality, support, and improvement: To maintain and enhance app features, debug issues, and ensure service integrity.

## On-Device Processing

Where possible, image frames are processed locally on your device (e.g., face verification and barcode scanning). When you explicitly upload images (e.g., profile photo or receipts), those images are transmitted securely to our servers to provide the requested feature.

## Data Sharing

- We do not sell personal information.
- Service providers: We may share minimal data with third-party providers strictly to deliver services (e.g., crash reporting, analytics, ads). These providers are bound by confidentiality and data protection obligations.
- Legal: We may disclose information if required by law or to protect our rights and users.

## Advertising

Our app integrates Google Mobile Ads. Ad networks may collect device identifiers and usage information to display and measure ads, in accordance with their policies. You can learn more at Google’s Advertising Policies and opt-out options on your device.

## Data Retention

We retain information only as long as necessary to provide the service, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce agreements. You may request deletion of your account data via the contact below.

## Your Choices

- Permissions: You can deny camera or photo library permissions. Some features may not work without these permissions.
- Access/Deletion: Contact us to request access or deletion of your data associated with your account.

## Children’s Privacy

Our app is not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## Security

We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect your information. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post the updated version within the app and/or on our website. Continued use of the app after changes indicates acceptance of the updated policy.

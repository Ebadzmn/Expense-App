Updated Privacy Policy (Camera Permission Reason Added Clearly)
Privacy Policy for Your Expense

Last updated: 2025-11-05

Your Expense ("we", "our", or "us") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your choices. This policy applies to our mobile application available on Google Play and the Apple App Store.

Information We Collect

Camera data:
We access your device camera to allow you to capture photos of invoices and receipts for OCR (Optical Character Recognition).
This enables the app to automatically extract expense details (date, amount, vendor, items) and add them to your expense list.

The camera may also be used for:

Barcode/QR scanning

Optional profile photo capture

(If enabled) App Lock or face verification features

We do NOT use the camera for any purpose other than the features you explicitly trigger.

Photos (Gallery Access):
If you choose to upload an invoice/receipt from your gallery instead of using the camera, we access the selected image only.

Basic app data:
Device information (model, OS version), crash logs, and usage analytics required to operate and improve the app.

Purchase data:
For subscriptions or in-app purchases, we receive only the transaction identifiers from Google Play or Apple App Store.

How We Use Your Information

Invoice/OCR Processing (Main Camera Use Case):
When you take a picture of an invoice or receipt, the app processes the image locally or via our secure backend to extract expense data.
This is the primary reason your device camera is required.

Barcode/QR scanning:
Camera frames are processed on-device to extract barcode/QR information.
No images are sent to our servers unless you choose to upload content.

Profile image upload:
If you upload a profile photo, it is securely stored on our backend and displayed in your account.

Face verification / App Lock (if enabled):
Camera frames are processed on-device only to verify your identity for unlocking the app.
We do not save or sell biometric data.

App functionality, support, and improvement:
To maintain and enhance features, debug issues, and ensure service quality.

On-Device Processing

Where possible, image frames (e.g., for invoice scanning, face verification, barcode scanning) are processed locally on your device.
Only when you intentionally upload an image (e.g., a receipt or profile photo) is it transmitted securely to our server.

Data Sharing

We do not sell personal information.

Service providers: Limited data may be shared with third parties for analytics, crash reporting, or OCR processing.

Legal reasons: We may disclose information if required by law or to protect user rights.

Advertising

Our app integrates Google Mobile Ads.
Ad networks may collect device identifiers and usage information to display relevant ads, following their privacy standards and your device settings.

Data Retention

We retain data only as long as necessary for:

App functionality

Legal obligations

User account operations

You may request deletion of your data at any time via the contact below.

Your Choices

You can deny camera or gallery permissions, but:

Invoice/receipt scanning (OCR)

Barcode/QR scanning

Profile image capture
will not work without camera access.

You may request access or deletion of your stored account data.

Children’s Privacy

This app is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

Security

We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical measures to protect your information.
However, no method of storage or transmission is 100% secure.

Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy periodically.
Continued use of the app means you accept the updated terms.
